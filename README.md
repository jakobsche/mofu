Move furniture with this tool, when it will be ready (may be, it will be a CAD app made with the best and most rapid application development tool)
This project was inspired by the problem, that it is hard to put furnitures in place to see whether it is placed good. With this tool it will possible to draw the ground plan of a room and the furnitures so that the furnitures can be moved with the mouse to see, whether it will will be a good arrangement in reality.

This project might depend on packages that are not available at a time, so that you cannot compile it yourself, but you will get compiled versions in the "bin" directory to see, how it works when it is compiled with all dependencies, and you can see, how easy the source code is made.

The original UI is made in German. Translations might be available later.
Try this app on Raspberry Pi (arm-linux version, when it will be compiled here). Because of its rapid execution and low hardware ressource usage it should be usable there with joy.

The current prototype does only few very simple tests with the used CAD library. Watch it grow step by step!
